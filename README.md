# Cactus_AVM
Collection of scripts to help make gaming on Linux the best way to play. Just one script atm, though :)

I don't have anything to put here, at this time. Massive thank you to the general Python community, as well as ThirteenAG, Cookieplmonster and P3ti.

I'm not 100% certain how to do the licensing thing, but I think I did it correctly.

If you have any problems with images not appearing, be sure you're running the python script with the terminal directory being where the .py file is.

So, CD into the directory with the .py, and run 'python cactus_bully.py'.

Any problems, please let me know.

I have no idea what I'm doing, but it's exciting :D
